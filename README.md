# youth-conference

> I'm curious if you could easily write a script to help me automate an optimal group list for our upcoming youth conference.  I had the youth list up to three friends and said every effort would be made to pair them with at least one.  The actual ideal outcome is to pair them with no more than one, while controlling for age, group size, and aiming for as even a distribution between wards in the stake as possible.
